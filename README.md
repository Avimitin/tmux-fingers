# tmux-fingers

**tmux-fingers**: copy pasting with vimium/vimperator like hints.

# Usage

When called ( `prefix + F` ), it will highlight relevant stuff in the current
pane along with letter hints. By pressing those letters, the highlighted match
will be yanked. Less keystrokes == profit!

Relevant stuff:

* File paths
* git SHAs
* numbers with 4+ digits

It also works on copy mode, but requires *tmux 2.2* or newer to properly take
the scroll position into account.

# Installation

## Using [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

Add the following to your list of TPM plugins in `.tmux.conf`:

```
set -g @plugin 'Morantron/tmux-fingers'
```

Hit `prefix + I` to fetch and source the plugin. You should now be able to use
the plugin!

## Manual

Clone the repo:

```
âžœ git clone https://github.com/Morantron/tmux-fingers ~/clone/path
```

Source it in your `.tmux.conf`:

```
run-shell ~/clone/path/tmux-fingers.tmux
```

Reload TMUX conf by running:

```
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

# Customization

You can change the key that invokes **tmux-fingers**:

```
# F is the default, but you can set another one
set -g @fingers-key F
```

You can also add additional patterns if you want more stuff to be highlighted:

```
set -g @fingers-pattern-0 'git rebase --(abort|continue)'
set -g @fingers-pattern-1 'yolo'
.
.
.
set -g @fingers-pattern-50 'whatever.*'
```

NOTE: patterns are case insensitive, and grep's extended syntax should be used.
`man grep` for more info.

If the introduced regexp contains an error, an error will be shown when
invoking the plugin.
